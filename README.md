# Concerning the Time-Series-Project
Phase 1: In this phase, we analyze the time series by examining the trend, detecting structural changes, and assessing seasonality. We will consider different trend models, such as random walks or polynomial models. Additionally, we will explore potential transformations for the original series.

Phase 2: We justify our choices for adjusting the time series by discussing differentiation and the use of functional forms. Next, we compare different candidate models to best represent the series.

Phase 3: Here, we apply tests and statistics to determine the structures and complexities of candidate ARIMA models. We support our choice of the ARIMA model using graphical and statistical arguments, allowing for an efficient modeling of the time series in question.
